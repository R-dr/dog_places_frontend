# T3A2 Off The Leash

## Purpose

> “Everyone thinks they have the best dog. And none of them are wrong.” – W.R. Purche

Over one third of households in Australia have a pet dog, giving Australia one of the highest rates of pet ownship in the world. That's over 3.6 million households with a dog eagerly waiting at the front door for it's owner, snoozing on the couch in the sun, or chasing a ball around the garden. Dogs are traditionally known as "man's best friend" and many people consider them part of their family. This app is designed to help people include their four legged family member in day-to-day activities in addition to planning outing the whole family can enjoy.

The app is designed to help people find locations and plan activities that are "dog-friendly". This might be an off-lead park, a cafe that welcomes dogs or even to Bunnings for a sausage. Users can search the location of places and see what facilities there are for them and their four legged friend.

## Features

- Dog-places app will feature a fully fledged Rails api and a sleek React front end to allow anyone to access the site at any time on any device.
- Dog-places app will use a geolocation service to retrieve and update locations that users have vistied or propose new location for the user to check out whilst listing facilities available at said location.

## Target audience

- THe target audience for this app is anyone looking for places that are dog-friendly in some way. They may be looking a cafe close to home they can regularly go to, or further afield if say, they are planning a car trip and after places they can stop to stretch their dogs legs. They may be after an fenced area they can do training or just somewhere to socialise and make friends (2 and 4 legged variety).

## Trello board

We used Trello as a project management tool. This helped us visualise our progress, keep track of timeframes, and assign priority.

## User Stories

### Initial MVP

- As a user I want a convenient way to see what facilities are available so I know what is there.
- As a user I want to see locations of facilities, so I know where it is.
- As a user I want to see facilities on a map so that I can visualize where they are.
- As a user I want to be able to add facilities so that I can contribute to the database
- As a user I want to be able to edit or delete places I added.
- As a user I want to be able to rate and comment on places so that there is more feedback on the facilities.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want to see the distance of a facility from my current location.
- pull data from a separate API for extra data
